Homework/In-Class Exercises/Participation
---------------------------

somewhat light on in-class exercise, but
good participation in class generally

Programming Assignments
-----------------------

very good.

Exams
-----

Midterm One:
 - good structure, syntax, naming.
 - basic functionality done for all three problems.
 - in least_common, you reported indexes not the values
 - in loneliest_number, you used a different definition of distance.

 Your current grade for exams is B. You have good fundamentals,
 with practice this can improve.
 

Project
-------

Brick Breaker. Excellent work. Good game play, very few bugs.
Good code design (and excellent team debates and thought)

Final Grade
-----------

Your current letter grade is B+.

If you are satisfied with that grade, you need not 
complete the final exam. Excellent work on the final exam 
could raise your grade, but not lower it.

Also, if you want to do work on the programming assignments 
between now and Thursday, I will consider a bump up to A-.
